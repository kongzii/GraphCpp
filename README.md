- Find Strongly Connected Components and create graph from them
- Calc ST certificate / Create graph from provided certificate
- Find and create vector of separated graphs from main one
- Longest path
- Euler theorem
- Find and remove cycles
- Adjacent matrix representation 
- Distance between A and B
- Shortest path between A and B
- Find leaves
